# Reimagined-winner
A no-fuss habit tracker that runs in your terminal. Helps you stay on top of daily habits without needing fancy apps or online accounts. Just Python, your goals, and a few commands.

This project started as a personal tool to keep me consistent with small daily goals like reading, exercising, and drinking water, but it grew into something anyone can use. Itâ€™s offline, simple, and does exactly what I need without distractions.
